# Data Analysis Project Template

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a template that I developed for students in QTM/ENGRD 302W: Technical Writing for Data Science at Emory University.

The template provides you with a basic directory structure for your data analysis research project, from which you can create your own repository here on GitHub to clone to your own computer. It contains instructions on using the package renv to manage a virtual environment with your project's package dependencies. Further, it walks through preparing your repository for working with [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), making use of the [holepunch package](https://karthik.github.io/holepunch/articles/getting_started.html) to generate the necessary files.

## Getting Started

1. Click the green "Use this template" in the upper-right-hand corner of the screen, and select "Create a new repository." Give it a good descriptive name for your project.

2. Clone your new repository to your local computer that has R and Studio installed. You can do this in a number of ways:

  - Using the [command line](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github)
  - From within RStudio, by selecting the "Version Control" option when Creating a New Project, and then "Clone a project from a Git repository"
  - Using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). After installing, you can click the "Code" button on your repository page and open it in GitHub Desktop from there. Otherwise, you can follow the [instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/adding-a-repository-from-your-local-computer-to-github-desktop  ).
  
3. Rename `DataSciProjectTemplate.Rproj` and then open it in RStudio.

4. In the Files pane, open `reproducibility.Rmd` and follow along inside the document.
